## 🎯 The Problem

Developers context-switch constantly — GitHub for issues and PRs. There's no single place that says *"here's what actually matters right now."* Every tool requires separate logins, separate queries, and mental stitching.

## ✨ What Dev's First Mate Does

- 🐛 Triages open GitHub issues — ordered by recency so nothing falls through
- 🔁 Detects duplicate issues — using keyword matching to cut noise
- ✅ Drafts release notes — auto-generated from merged PRs
- ⚡️ Cross-source JOIN — GitHub + Slack answered in one Coral SQL query
- 🤖 MCP Integration — AI agents can query your data directly via Coral's MCP server

```
SELECT number, title, state, created_at
FROM github.issues
WHERE repo = 'devs_first_mate' AND state = 'open'

LIMIT 10
```

### Cross-source JOIN — GitHub + Slack in one query
```
SELECT g.number, g.title, s.text AS slack_discussion
FROM github.issues g
JOIN slack.messages s ON s.channel_id = 'CHANNEL_ID'
WHERE g.state = 'open'
ORDER BY g.created_at DESC
```

### Schema Discovery
```
SELECT schema_name, table_name
FROM coral.tables
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

### Release Notes from Merged PRs
```
SELECT number, title, merged_at
FROM github.pulls
